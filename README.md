## Problem Statement:
Social Media has ingrained into the string of our daily activities close in vigour to simply existing. For our LGBTQ+community, it became a million opportunities, but with it came a slew of reasons to oppose. The lack of a safe, no-hate community to discuss, reason and question in a way that only they can resonate with is the only lacking point to add to the betterment of their lives.

## Personas of the system:
The application will primarily be used by members of the LGBTQ+ community--henceforth identified as users--and secondarily the supporting figures in and around the community, including doctors, social workers etc. Since it is a closed community, verification for these three types of users will be implemented. 
Their usecase includes researchig and enquiring about their physical health using our healthcare assistant. They can also avail remote group therapy and individal discussions vis the chatbot. The blogging feature can be used to talk about their problems and hurdles and to take inspiration from like minded people. And finally, the job posting system can be used to avail jobs and employees towards inclusive companies and other jobs.

## Architecture:
######Technical Architecture:
Front-end:
HTML and CSS was used to create the entire UI, including the landing page, add blog and blog feed pages.
Back-end: 
PHP was used as the back-end to implement the logic, coordination of pages and link between front-end and database. With it, the website was made dynamic.
Database:
MySQL and specifically PHPMYADMIN was used to create the database. There were mainly two tables that were linked using a single foreign key over the User-Id. Tables included, User and Post.
Healthcare Assistant: (AI Chatbot)
The IBM Watson chatbot was used to create the chatbot, by including the symptoms as intents and from that dialogues were provided as the treatment.
