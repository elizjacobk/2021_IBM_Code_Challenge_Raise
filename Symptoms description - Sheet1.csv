,"Hey there, Vaginal discharge that is brownish yellow should be expected in the first 4-6 weeks postoperatively. Bleeding and spotting should be expected in the first 8 weeks postoperatively. Soap and water douche should help reduce this. Chamomile or lavender liquid soap can help cleanse the neo vagina as well. A small amount of white or clear discharge is normal or healthy. There shouldn’t be any pain. If there’s pain, or discomfort, or if something doesn’t smell right, these are things that should get checked out."
